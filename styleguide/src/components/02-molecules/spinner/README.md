# Spinner v1.0.0

The Spinner component provides an overlay with a centered spinner animation. It can be used either by just adding its classes to an element/a component or as a stand alone element (absolute positioned).
As standard, pseudo elements are used to get the work done. If the target component already has pseudo elements you will need to use the spinner in a stand alone element (*is own element* variant).
