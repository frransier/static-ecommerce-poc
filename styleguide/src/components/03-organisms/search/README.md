# Search v1.0.0

Displays a search field and a result list (of articles). Use the search--open CSS modifier to show/hide the component.

**Note:**

- The component is absolute positioned and is therefore dependent of a relative element for its placement.
- This component is implemented in Vue and if data-js="search" is used, Vue will use that element to inject its own template.
