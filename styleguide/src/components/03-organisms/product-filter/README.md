# product-filter v1.0.0

The parent filter component for product filtering. This component has two markup implementations, one in VueJS and one in Handlebars. The `data-js="product-filter"` is what tells VueJS to hijack the content of the component and replace the static Handlebars implementation with a more dynamic implementation.

NOTE: The `--is-visible` variant has a left-value that makes it not align correctly when not viewd in context. If the component is viewed in the master context it will look as it should.

NOTE (also): There's a basic implementation done in Vue. This is a bit sloppy done in order to test different states in the filter, but it could be used
as a base at the implementation.
When the implementation is done, remove the variant in the styleguide along with this text - thank you for your cooperation. Have a nice day! The ðŸŽ‚ is a lie.
